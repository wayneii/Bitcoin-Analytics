# Bitcoin-Analytics
This is a compilation of files I use to analyze transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain. I plan to iterate on the analysis and optimization model over time, so they can become more practical. The goal being to be able to analyze real time data of Bitcoin and concurrently have an optimization model to effectively build my own mining operation.
